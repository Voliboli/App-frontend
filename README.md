## Dependencies

The only prerequisite is to have installed the following tools:
- Python 3.8 <=
- pipenv

Then other dependencies can be installed using:

    pipenv install

## Run

You can run this project using:

	pipenv run streamlit run app.py
	
## Working principle

For frontend we use Streamlit that simplifies the design of webpage by providing various pre-created templates one can use. 
The main page of the Web Page already provides you with a significant information about what and how you can use the application.
